QUESTION 1:
Create a for loop that will iterate over the string named superLongWord and print each letter in its value.

superLongWord = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
#Enter code below this line
for element in superLongWord:
    print(element, end=' ')
print("\n")

QUESTION 2:
Create a for loop that will iterate over the string named superLongNumber and print each number in its value.

superLongNumber = "01203445957932123239212084566101"
#Enter code below this line
for element in superLongNumber:
    print(element, end=' ')
print("\n")

QUESTION 3:
create an array that contains the two variables above.

superLongWord = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
superLongNumber = "01203445957932123239212084566101"
strings = [superLongWord, superLongNumber]
print(strings)

QUESTION 4:
Get the length of the array and create a while loop that will iterate over the elements of the array.

superLongWord = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
superLongNumber = "01203445957932123239212084566101"
strings = [superLongWord, superLongNumber]
x = len(strings)
while x >= 2:
    print(strings)

QUESTION 5:
Create an infinite loop of the array.

strings = ["supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", "01203445957932123239212084566101"]

while True:
    for element in strings:
        print(element)

QUESTION 6:
Create a loop that will increment the variable n until it reaches a value of 25.

n = 0

while n <= 25:
    print(n)
    n += 1

QUESTION 7:
Create a loop that adds on letters to the variable named alaphabet until all letters of the alphabet have been added.

alphabet = ''
for letter in range(ord('a'), ord('z')+1):
    alphabet += chr(letter)
print(alphabet)

QUESTION 8:
Create a loop that adds on numbers to the variable named twentyNums until all numbers 0-20 have been added.

twentyNums = []

for i in range(21):
    twentyNums.append(i)

print(twentyNums)

QUESTION 9:
Print the 20th letter in the variable alphabet.

def print_20th_letter():
    alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
    print(alphabet[19])

QUESTION 10:
Print the 13th number in the variable twentyNums.

def print_13th_number():
    twentyNums = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20']
    print(twentyNums[12])
