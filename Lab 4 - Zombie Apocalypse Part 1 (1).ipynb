    "On your way to class you look out the car window to see a human that looks...ill. Being the good citizen you are, you stop to see whats wrong. As you approach them, they lunge forward aggressively and bite you. Moments later a gunshot from behind you can be heard and the..thing in front of you falls to the ground. \"You should probably be more careful\" a deep voice says angrily. You turn around to see a tall man clothed in what looks like a dozen layers of clothing and a mask holding a rifle. \"Did it get ya\"? Looking down you see a large red bite that appears to be growing on your arm. The man in horror, quickly pulls out a piece of paper in one of his jackets and hands it to you before running away. "
